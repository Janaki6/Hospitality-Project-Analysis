I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a Data Analysis project for AtliQ Hotels, a prestigious luxury hotel chain in India operating across Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.

Problem Statement: AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue.

üéØ Project Goal: Our objective was to enhance AtliQ Grands' market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel segment by implementing data-driven strategies and business intelligence solutions.

The project, executed in Python using Pandas within Jupyter Notebook, followed a structured approach:

‚Ä¢ Data Import and Exploration: Understanding the dataset's structure and content.

‚Ä¢ Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality and consistency.

‚Ä¢ Data Transformation: Preparing the data for analysis.

‚Ä¢ Analysis Insights: Extracting actionable insights to drive business decisions.

Key Metrices:
‚Ä¢	ADR (Average Daily Rate): The average revenue earned per room sold in a given time period. 

‚Ä¢	DBRN (Daily Booking Room Nights): The average number of rooms are booked for a day considering a time period

‚Ä¢	DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): The average number of rooms available for sale per day over a specified time period. 

‚Ä¢	DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): The average number of rooms successfully occupied by guests per day over a specified time period.
