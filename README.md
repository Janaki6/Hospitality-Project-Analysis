# Python_Project


I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a Data Analysis project for AtliQ Hotels, a prestigious luxury hotel chain in India operating across Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.

The project, executed in Python using Pandas within Jupyter Notebook, followed a structured approach:
•	Data Import and Exploration: Understanding the dataset's structure and content.
•	Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality and consistency.
•	Data Transformation: Preparing the data for analysis.
•	Analysis Insights: Extracting actionable insights to drive business decisions.
